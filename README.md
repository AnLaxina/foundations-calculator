# Introduction
Nearly finished the foundations portion of the Odin Project!

## Some Thoughts
- This project was so difficult! Figuring out the logic between the two operands was painful...
- Despite that, it was a LOT of fun making the frontend and the backend (albeit the backend isn't the most easiest to read)

## Moving Forward
- I need to figure out how to seperate JavaScript files into their own respective files instead of having all my code into one big JavaScript file.
